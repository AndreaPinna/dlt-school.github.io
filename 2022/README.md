# 3rd Scientific School on Blockchain & Distributed Ledger Technologies

**Pula (Italy), June 27 - July 1, 2022**


Crypto economics is a new discipline born after the rise of virtual
currencies and distributed ledger technologies, and is rapidly
developing in a unique intersection between computing, cryptography,  law,
economics, and game theory. The school aims at disseminating  knowledge
about the foundations and the applications of these
technologies to researchers, PhD students, scholars and technologists in
industry and academia, not excluding under- or new graduates with strong
technical drive and a sufficient background.
