# 1st Scientific School on Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies

**Pula (Italy), 12-15 June 2018**

Crypto economics is a new discipline born after the rise of virtual currencies and distributed ledger technologies, and is rapidly developing in a unique intersection between computing, cryptography, law, economics, and game theory. The school aims at disseminating knowledge about the foundations and the applications of these technologies to researchers, PhD students, scholars and technologists in industry and academia, not excluding under- or new graduates with strong technical drive and a sufficient background.

## Important dates

- Application deadline: April 15, 2018
- Notification: April 31, 2018
- School dates: June 12-15, 2018


## Venue & accommodation

The school will be hosted at the Technology Park of Sardinia in Pula﻿ (Sardinia, Italy).


## Registration & selection

The registration and attendance is FREE of charge. However, as we may not be able to accomodate all the applicants, the attendees will be selected by the scientific committee on a CV best-match basis. This implies that candidates showing the attitude to receive the most value from the lectures will be given higher priority. The school plans for a maximum of 38 attendees with a quota of 12 seats reserved to scholars coming from CRS4, University of Cagliari and from SMEs located in Sardinia. Should this quota remain unfilled, the remainder seats will be redistributed to waitlisted partecipants.
