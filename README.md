# 4th Scientific School on Blockchain & Distributed Ledger Technologies

Cagliari, Sardinia, Italy

*September 12-15, 2023*

Crypto economics is a new discipline born after the rise of virtual currencies and distributed ledger technologies, and is rapidly developing in a unique intersection between computing, cryptography,  law,
economics, and game theory. The school aims at disseminating  knowledge about the foundations and the applications of these technologies to researchers, PhD students, scholars and technologists in industry and academia, not excluding under- or new graduates with strong technical drive and a sufficient background.


## Venue

The school, which is planned as a physical, in-person event, will be hosted at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science of the University of Cagliari (Italy).


## Registration & selection

The school plans for a maximum of 20 attendees; the attendance to the school is **FREE**, while travel and accommodation expenses are to be paid by participants (there are several affordable accommodations in Cagliari). 
The participants will be selected by the scientific  committee on a CV best-match basis.
